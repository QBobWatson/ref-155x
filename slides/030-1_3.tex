\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}

We want to think about the \emph{algebra} in linear algebra (systems of
equations and their solution sets) in terms of \emph{geometry} (points, lines,
planes, etc).

  \draw[->] (0,-20) -- (0,20);
  \draw[seq1, thick] (-20,-20/3+1) -- (20,20/3+1);
  \draw[seq2, thick] (-20,40+8) -- (20,-40+8);
  \point at (3,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\bigskip
\pause
This will give us better insight into the properties of systems of equations and
their solution sets.

\bigskip
\pause
To do this, we need to introduce $n$-dimensional space $\R^n$, and
\textbf{vectors} inside it.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Line, Plane, Space, $\ldots$}
Recall that $\R$ denotes the collection of all real numbers, i.e.\ the number
line.
\pause

\begin{defn}
  Let $n$ be a positive whole number.  We define
  \[ \R^n = \text{all ordered } n\text{-tuples of real numbers }
  (x_1,\,x_2,\,x_3,\,\ldots,\,x_n). \]
\end{defn}

\pause

\begin{eg}
  When $n=1$, we just get $\R$ back: $\R^1 = \R$.  Geometrically, this is the
  \emph{number line}.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw [<->, thick] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5,0);
      \foreach \x in {-3,...,3}
         \draw[thin] (\x,-.1) -- (\x,0.1) node[anchor=south] {\small$\x$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
\end{eg}

\vskip-3mm
\begin{eg}
  When $n=2$, we can think of $\R^2$ as the \emph{plane}.  This is because every
  point on the plane can be represented by an ordered pair of real numbers,
  namely, its $x$- and $y$-coordinates.
  \vskip .5cm
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.append style={whitebg, thin border},

      \draw[->, thick] (-4,0) -- (4,0);
      \draw[->, thick] (0,-4) -- (0,4);
      \point[seq-blue, "{$(1,2)$}" above right] at (1,2);
      \point[seq-blue, "{$(0,-3)$}" above right] at (0,-3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \pause We can use the elements of $\R^2$ to \emph{label} points on the
  plane, but $\R^2$ is not defined to be the plane!

\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  When $n=3$, we can think of $\R^3$ as the \emph{space} we (appear to) live
  in.  This is because every point in space can be represented by an ordered
  triple of real numbers, namely, its $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-coordinates.

      \draw[->, thick] (0,-4,0) -- (0,4,0);

      \draw[thick] (0,0,-4) -- (0,0,-2);
      \draw[thick,gray] (0,0,-2) -- (0,0,0);
      \draw[thin, densely dotted] (1,-1,3) -- (1,-1,0);

      \point[seq-blue, "${(-2,2,2)}$" above] at (-2,2,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \pause Again, we can use the elements of $\R^3$ to \emph{label} points in
  space, but $\R^3$ is not defined to be space!

\end{eg}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Line, Plane, Space, $\ldots$}
\framesubtitle{Continued}

So what is $\R^4$?  or $\R^5$?  or $\R^n$?\\[2mm]
\pause\hskip 1em\ldots
go back to the \emph{definition}: ordered $n$-tuples of real numbers
\[ (x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_n). \]

\pause\bigskip
They're still ``geometric'' spaces, in the sense that our intuition for $\R^2$
and $\R^3$ sometimes extends to $\R^n$, but they're harder to visualize.

\pause\bigskip
We'll make definitions and state theorems that apply to any $\R^n$, but we'll
only draw pictures for $\R^2$ and $\R^3$.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vectors}
In the previous slides, we were thinking of elements of $\R^n$ as
\textbf{points}: in the line, plane, space, etc.

\pause\medskip
We can also think of them as \textbf{vectors}: arrows with a given length and
direction. 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5, every pin/.style={whitebg, thin border}]
      \draw[grid lines] (-1,-1) grid (4, 4);
      \draw[->, thick] (-1,0) -- (4,0);
      \draw[->, thick] (0,-1) -- (0,4);
      \point[seq-blue, pin={
          [pin edge={seq-blue}, text=seq-blue, right]
          10:the point $(1,3)$}] (x) at (1,3);
      \draw[thick vector, green!50!black] (0,0)
        -- node[midway, pin={[right]-10:the vector $1\choose3$}] {} (x);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\pause
So the vector points \emph{horizontally} in the amount of its $x$-coordinate,
and \emph{vertically} in the amount of its $y$-coordinate.

\pause\medskip
When we think of an element of $\R^n$ as a vector, we write it as a matrix with
$n$ rows and one column:
\[ v = \vec{ 1 2 3}. \]
We'll see why this is useful later.

\note{Some authors use $\bb v$.}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Points and Vectors}
So what is the difference between a point and a vector?%
\note{There isn't really any difference\ldots}

\pause\medskip
A vector need not start at the origin: \emph{it can be located anywhere\/}!
In other words, an arrow is determined by its length and its direction, not
by its location.\\[1mm]
\hbox to \linewidth{\hss
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
  \draw[help lines] (-1,-1) grid (4, 4);
  \draw[thick vector, seq-green] (0,1) -- (1,3);
  \draw[thick vector, seq-green] (1,1) -- (2,3);
  \draw[thick vector, seq-green] (2,0) -- (3,2);
  \node[anchor=west, text width=7.8cm] (a) at (5, 3.3)
    {These arrows all represent the vector $\color{seq-green}\vec{1 2}$.};
  \node<3->[below=.9cm of a.south west, anchor=west, bluebox, text width=7.5cm,
      inner sep=5pt, align=justify]
    {
      However, unless otherwise specified, we'll assume a vector starts
      at the origin: we'll usually be sloppy and identify the vector
      ${1\choose 2}$ with the point $(1,2)$.
    };
\end{tikzpicture}\hss}

\begin{uncoverenv}<4->\medskip
This makes sense in the real world: many physical quantities, such as velocity,
are represented as vectors.  But it makes more sense to think of the velocity of
a car as being located at the car.

\pause[5]\medskip
Another way to think about it: a vector is a \emph{difference} between two
points, or the arrow from one point to another.

\pause\medskip
For instance, $\vec{1 2}$ is the arrow from $(1,1)$ to $(2,3)$.\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}[overlay, baseline=.75cm, scale=.5,
    whitebg nodes, thin border nodes]
  \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
  \draw[->] (0,0) -- (3,0);
  \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,3);
  \point["${(1,1)}$" {left, text=seq-red}, seq-red] (x) at (1,1);
  \point["${(2,3)}$" {right, text=seq-green}, seq-green] (y) at (2,3);
  \draw[vector, seq-blue] (x)
    -- node[below right=1pt] {${1\choose 2}$} (y);

\begin{defn}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We can add two vectors together:
    \[ \vec{ a b c} + \vec{ x y z} = \vec{ a+x b+y c+z}. \]
    \pause
  \item We can multiply, or \textbf{scale}, a vector by a real number $c$:
    \[ \def\r{\textcolor{red}} \r c\vec{ x y z} 
    = \vec{ \r c\cdot x \r c\cdot y \r c\cdot z}. \]
    \pause
    We call $c$ a \textbf{scalar} to distinguish it from a vector.  If $v$ is a
    vector and $c$ is a scalar, $cv$ is called a \textbf{scalar multiple} of
    $v$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\pause
(And likewise for vectors of length $n$.)

\webonlycmd{
\[ \vec{ 1 2 3} + \vec{ 4 5 6} = \vec{ 5 7 9} \sptxt{and} 
-2\vec{ 1 2 3} = \vec{-2 -4 -6}. \]
